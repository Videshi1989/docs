// to exclude and include file and folder during compile time

(1) Generate json config file by below command(inside folder location):
    tsc -init
	
(2) mention those ts files which you do not want to compile, after "compilerOptions" with json config file	:
    ex:
	
	{
		"compilerOptions": 
		{
			"target": "es2016",                                  
			"module": "commonjs",                                
			"forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,            
			"strict": true,                                      
			"skipLibCheck": true                                 
		},
		"exclude":["index.ts","unit.ts","inner","src/contact.ts","*/test.ts"]
	}
	
	Note: 
	(i) where inner is a folder, contact.ts is a file with in src folder and test.ts is a specific file can avail any where in main folder but that will not compile.
	
(3) mention those ts files which you want to compile rest you do not want to compile, after "compilerOptions" with json config file	:

	{
		"compilerOptions": 
		{

			"module": "commonjs",                                
			"forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,            
			"strict": true,                                      
			"skipLibCheck": true                                 
		},
		"include":["index.ts","unit.ts","inner","src/contact.ts","*/test.ts"]
	}	
	
	Note: 
	(i) where inner is a folder, contact.ts is a file with in src folder and test.ts is a specific file can avail any where in main folder.
	
(4) compile all files by tsc command
